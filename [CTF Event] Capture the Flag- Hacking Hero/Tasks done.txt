Tasks done : 
Task 1:
 ➔ Studied the provided tools and resources for approaches to CTF.
 ➔ Used Nmap to scan the ports on the target server for obtain the list of open 
ports.
 ➔ Used the list of open ports to access the flag 1 through page source.
 ➔ identified and submitted flag 1 in CTF.
Worked on developing the python script for automating this attack.

 Task 2:
 ➔ Studied the working and usage of goBuster tool for finding the hidden 
directories
 ➔identifying the hidden directories in the 
server.
 ➔ Identified and submitted flag 2 in CTF.
 ➔ Used the port and directory information to access and find the flag 2.
 ➔ Worked on developing the python script for automating this attack.

 Task 3:
 ➔ Used the key obtained from flag 2 and identified the command to connect to the
 server through ssh.
 ➔ Generated the key file using the RSA private key obtained in flag 2.
 ➔ Looked into the contents of the server once connected using ssh.
 ➔ Identified and viewed the flag 3 and submitted it in CTF.
 ➔ Worked on developing the python script for automating this attack.

 Task 4:
 ➔ Studied  on the ways to access the flag 4 (under root user) with 
Manisha.
 ➔ Studied on the ways to access the flag 4 (under root user) with 
Tejas.
 ➔ Looked for ways including Elevated permission method and Metasploit.
 Report writing and creating ReadMe :
 ➔ Prepared the report for the activity and the created python script including the 
readme with the depedencies
 ➔ Used Metasploit on the open ports for collecting HeartBleed data. Used TShark 
to capture the pcap and identify the Base64 password.
 ➔ Decoded the Base64 password and accessed the flag 4 using sudo.
 ➔ Identified and submitted flag 4 in CTF.
 ➔ Worked on developing the python script for automating this attack.
 Report writing and creating ReadMe :
 ➔ Helped in report writing by providing relevant data for attacks and python 
script.
